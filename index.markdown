Welcome to the website of the Modeling & analYsis foR medical Imaging and Diagnosis (MYRIAD) research team of the CREATIS laboratory, headed by Professor [Olivier Bernard](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~bernard/). Our team focuses on image processing, statistical and physical modeling, image simulation in the field of medical imaging. If you are interested in collaborating with us, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:olivier.bernard@creatis.insa-lyon.fr)!

Drawing heavily on the [VITALab website](https://vitalab.github.io/), which is one of our main collaborators at the University of Sherbrooke, we have set up this website to keep up to date with new advances in our research areas. In that perspective, each time a member of the team finds an interesting paper, he/she can share it via this repo. In this way, a paper read and understood by a person gets shared with the rest of the people.
