# Highlights
- New self-supervised learning framework, called DINO, that synergizes especially well with vision transformers (ViT);
- In-depth comparison of emerging properties ViT pretrained with DINO, compared to convolutional networks (convnets) and
other ViT trained in a supervised fashion. The most interesting emerging properties are:
    - Self-attention modules of the last block explicitly contain scene layout and object boundaries;
    - Features perform well at top-1 accuracy on ImageNet when used as input to a basic nearest neighbor classifier.


# Introduction
The authors theorize that one of the main reasons for the success of transformers in NLP is the use of self-supervised
training, and that the muted success of ViT comes from supervision in pretraining. According to them:
> image level supervision often reduces the rich visual information contained in an image to a single concept selected
> from a predefined set of a few thousand categories of objects.

While not proposing much brand new ideas, the authors perform a thorough investigative work into the engineering
required to make self-supervised ViT work in computer vision, listing the required tricks to avoid collapse during
training.


# Methods
The new contribution is a self-supervised training method called DINO, because it can interpreted as knowledge
**di**stillation with **no** labels. Fig. 2 summarizes the main idea behind DINO.

Main engineering components to ensure good training:
- **Multi-crop training**: The self-supervised training is formulated as learning to predict the same representation for
different crops of the image. The crops are categorized as global views (crop covers > 50% of the original image), or
local views (crop covers < 50% of the original image). The teacher network receives only global views, while the student
network receives all the crops. The idea behind this is to encourage "local-to-global" correspondence in extracted
features.
- **Momentum encoder**: The teacher network is updated with an exponential moving average (ema) of student parameters.
In contrast to other teacher-student approaches, the teacher here consistently out-performs the student. The authors
theorize that the teacher becomes a sort of model ensemble, similar to Polyak-Ruppert averaging.
- **Centering and sharpening of teacher outputs**: To avoid collapse towards learning trivial features, the authors
propose to use two operations with opposite effects on the teacher's outputs, that together make the network learn
adequately:
    - *Centering*: Basically adding a bias term to the output s.t. $$g_{\theta}(x) \leftarrow g_{\theta}(x) + c$$, where
    the centering term $$c$$ is computed on batch statistics and updated using an ema. It prevents one dimension from
    dominating a softmax, but encourages collapse to a uniform distribution.
    - *Sharpening*: Obtained by using a low value for the temperature $$\tau$$ in the softmax:
    $$\frac{exp(g_{\theta}(x) / \tau)}{\sum^K_{k=1} exp(g_{\theta}(x) / \tau)}$$. It has the opposite effect of
    centering, i.e. it "sharpens" the softmax, at the risk of letting one dimension dominate.


# Data
The authors mainly used DINO to pretrain ViT using ImageNet, but in some experiments' setup other (unsupervised)
datasets were used.


# Results
The full paper (and even more so with the supplementary materials) provides a lot of results on different downstream
tasks. They also provide a comprehensive ablation study regarding DINO's components, as well as an analysis of how and
why training fails when the framework lacks some essential tricks.

The figures/tables below were selected because they detail results on common image tasks/datasets.
