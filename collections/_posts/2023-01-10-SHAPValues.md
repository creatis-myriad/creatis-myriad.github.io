# Introduction

Currently used Machine-learning and Deep-learning models are increasingly powerful and complex. However, for legal, ethical or technical reasons, there is a growing need to understand how their predictions are made. To this end, there exists several methods approximating the model "prediction process", be it at the model scale or for individual predictions. _Global explanations_ focus on the model and its underlying decision process. Their goal is to get some sense of understanding of the mechanism by which the model works. On the other hand, _local explanations_ provide insights on why a particular predictions was made instead of another one.

Among the different local explainability methods, which include for example _Saliency maps_, _Prototype based_ or _Counterfactuals explanations_, this article focus on _Feature importance_ through Additive feature attribution models. These models estimate how inputs and outputs are correlated, and "how much" each feature of an input impact the prediction.

The authors propose a framework unifying existing _Feature importance_ based explanation model, proving their solution to be unique. With these theoretical results, the authors also proposed model-specific performance improvements through several assumptions.

# Shapley values

## Games and cooperation

Let's assume we trained a model to predict apartment prices based on few features. This model predicted a price of €300,000 for an apartment and we want to explain the prediction. This apartment is located on the 2nd floor with an area of 50m² and a park nearby while cats are banned.

For linear regression models, the answer is simple. The coefficients represent directly the impact of each feature value and if it's a positive or negative effect.

For more complex scenarios, Shapley values[^1] come to the rescue. They are a concept coming from game theory, describing how to fairly distribute a **payout** between **players** participating in a cooperative **game**. But how does it apply to explainability in machine learning? If we have a predictive model, then we can define:

- A **game**: reproducing the prediction of the model
- The **players**: the features of the input
- The **payout**: the individual impact of each feature to the prediction

To determine the importance of a single feature, the idea is to compute the difference between a prediction with the feature and another prediction without. This is the "marginal contribution" of the feature to the prediction.

![](/collections/images/shap/marginal_contribution.jpg)

But, as a cooperative game, multiple features are involved in the prediction, with possible hidden dependencies between them. So **each possible combination (or coalition) of features should be considered**, hence computing the "average marginal contribution". Thus, to explain the prediction for our apartment, we need to compute the predicted price for all coalitions **without** the `cat banned` feature AND all coalitions **with** the `cat banned` feature.

![](/collections/images/shap/coalitions_example.jpg)

The main interrogation that may arise from this setting is how a coalition can be represented. For example, how do we represent the empty coalition? With Shapley values, we need a model by possible coalition of features. Each of these models is trained exactly as the original but it only "looks at" its own coalition of features. This can be viewed as a way to estimate how a feature impact the prediction of a model and not how a model is resilient to feature perturbations.

## Properties

The formula to compute the Shapley value $$\phi_i$$ for feature $$i$$ is:

$$\phi_i(f, x) = \sum_{S \subseteq F \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|! (|F| - |S| - 1)!}{|F|!} (f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S)) \tag{1}$$

Where $$f(x)$$ is the prediction of a model $$f$$ for the input $$x$$ with $$\vert F \vert$$ features, and $$S$$ being a subset of the features used by the model. The $$F \setminus \{i\}$$ and $$S \cup \{i\}$$ notations are respectively the set of all features excluding $$i$$ and a selected coalition in which we include feature $$i$$. We can find the "marginal contribution" of the feature $$i$$ weighted by a coefficient dependant on the number of features in the coalition, summed over possible coalitions. This formula can also be expressed as:

$$\phi_i(f, x) = \frac{1}{|F|} \sum_{S \subseteq F \setminus \{i\}} \binom{|F| - 1}{|S|}^{-1} (f(S \cup \{i\}) - f(S)) \tag{2}$$

Which can be interpreted as:

$$\phi_i(f, x) = \frac{1}{\text{number of players}} \sum_\text{coalitions excluding $i$} \frac{\text{marginal contribution of $i$ to coalition}}{\text{number of coalitions (excluding $i$) of same size}}$$

The role of these Shapley values being to fairly distribute a reward, they exhibit certain properties:

**Efficiency** Feature contributions sum equals the difference between prediction for $$x$$ and the average prediction over the training dataset $$X$$:

$$\sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i = f(x) - E_X(f(X)) \tag{3}$$

**Symmetry** If two feature values contribute equally to all possible coalitions, their contributions should be the same:

$$\forall S \subseteq \{1,\dots,p\} \setminus \{i,j\}, \qquad f(S \cup \{i\}) = f(S \cup \{j\}) \implies \phi_i = \phi_j  \tag{4}$$

**Missingness** A feature $$i$$ which doesn't change the predicted value (no matter the coalition) should have a Shapley value of 0:

$$\forall S \subseteq \{1,\dots,p\} \setminus \{i\}, \qquad f(S \cup \{i\}) = f(S) \implies \phi_i = 0 \tag{5}$$

**Additivity (or linearity)** The effect of a feature on the sum of 2 models $$f + f'$$ equals the sum of the respective Shapley values:

$$\phi_i(f + f') = \phi_i(f) + \phi_i(f') \tag{6}$$

**Note**  
Be careful when interpreting Shapley values: they do NOT represent the difference in the prediction if removed from the model, they are the average contribution of a feature value to the prediction in different features coalitions.

# Additive feature attribution models

## Defining explanations

To summarize, our goal is to create a model $$g$$ which associates an explanation $$\phi$$ to a model's output $$f(x)$$:

$$g(f(x)) = \phi(f,x) \tag{7}$$

Explanation models often use _simplified inputs_ $$x'$$ that map to the original inputs through a mapping function $$x = h_x(x')$$. And local methods' goal is to ensure $$g(z') \approx f(h_x(z'))$$ whenever $$z' \approx x'$$. Those _simplified inputs_ usually represent the presence or absence of each features in the input, as a binary vector with $$z_i' \in \{0, 1\}$$.

With the **Efficiency** property of Shapley values in mind, we can define an _additive feature attribution_ model as a linear function of binary variables:

$$ g(z') = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{M} \phi_i z'_i \tag{8}$$

where $$z'$$ is a simplified input (thus $$z' \in \{0, 1\}^M$$), _M_ is the number of simplified input features, $$\phi_i \in \mathbb{R}$$, and $$\phi_0$$ is the average prediction ($$E_X[f(X)]$$, by definition).

## Unification of existing methods

More than their clean and clear theoretical background, Shapley values are the only set of values that satisfy previous properties as showed by [Young (1985)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01769885). So if a method trying to approximate features effect on a prediction is not based on Shapley values, they may break either _local accuracy_ (how faithful are their representation of the prediction) or _consistency_ (an increased effect should imply an increased Shapley value).

The authors then described other local explanation models such as LIME, DeepLIFT or Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and showed that these methods follow the previously defined model.

For a quick overview of these methods, LIME[^5] interprets individual model predictions by locally approximating the model around a given prediction. DeepLIFT[^6] recursively attributes effect to features, comparing each feature value to a reference value (deemed to be uninformative for this specific feature), using a linear composition rule. And Layer-wise Relevance Propagation[^7] is showed (by DeepLIFT paper) to be equivalent to DeepLIFT with each reference values being $$0$$.

# SHAP values

## Shapley sampling

Shapley values have a problem: their computation. It requires to calculate each possible coalition for each feature $$i$$, so $$2^N$$ with $$N$$ features. To resolve this, [Strumbelj et al. (2014)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x) proposed the _Shapley sampling_, an approximation with Monte-Carlo sampling:

$$\hat{\phi}_i = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \left( f(x_{+i}^m) - f(x_{-i}^m) \right) \tag{9}$$

where $$f(x_{+i}^m)$$ is the prediction for $$x$$ but with a random number of feature values replaced by feature values from a random data point $$z$$, except for feature $$i$$. _A contrario_, in $$x_{-i}^m$$, the feature $$i$$ is also taken from the sampled $$z$$. This creates some sort of "Frankenstein monster" instance assembled from two instances which, with enough iterations $$M$$, approximates the removal of a single feature value while keeping _some_ feature interactions.

This results in the following algorithm to compute the Shapley value for the feature $$i$$:

1. For all $$m=1,\dots,M$$:
   1. Draw a random instance $$z$$ from our dataset $$X$$

   2. Construct two new instances (features are ordered randomly here as a trick to select a random coalition, but they are presented as usual to the model):

        $$x_{+i} = (x_{(1)},\dots,x_{(i-1)},x_{(i)},z_{(i+1)},\dots,z_{(p)})$$

        $$x_{-i} = (x_{(1)},\dots,x_{(i-1)},z_{(i)},z_{(i+1)},\dots,z_{(p)})$$

   3. Compute the marginal contribution:
   
        $$\hat{\phi}_i^m = f(x_{+i}) - f(x_{-i})$$

2. Compute the Shapley value as the average of marginal contributions:

$$\hat{\phi}_i(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \hat{\phi}_i^m$$

## Modifications to existing methods

Given the fact that both LIME and DeepLIFT follow the _additive feature attribution_ model definition, they must approximate Shapley values. Otherwise, they violate either _local accuracy_ or _consistency_.

LIME is defined as a regression approximating the model $$f$$ around the simplified input $$x'$$ by the model $$g$$ weighted by a kernel $$\pi_{x'}$$ with a regularization term $$\Omega$$, thus minimizing the following objective:

$$\xi = \underset{g \in \mathcal{G}}{\arg\min} \; L(f, g, \pi_{x'}) + \Omega(g) \tag{10}$$

Through precisely defined parameters, this equation does allow to compute Shapley values. But parameters chosen heuristically in original LIME paper are not part of those "correct parameters". The authors propose a method to correctly choose these parameters by nullifying the regularization term $$\Omega$$ and using a square loss $$L$$ (between prediction and explanation) weighted by a kernel $$\pi_{x'}$$ ressembling the coefficient used in the original Shapley equation (Equation 1).

This improved LIME with new parameters is named **KernelSHAP** and retains the model-agnostic nature of LIME.

In the same way, the authors propose **DeepSHAP** an adaptation of DeepLIFT being a compositional approximation of Shapley values. The main ideas here are to interpret the _reference value_ used in DeepLIFT as representing $$E[x]$$ (the expectation of the input) and to choose a different linear composition rule, compatible with the computation of Shapley values.

## Results of the new methods

With Figure 3 below, the authors show that the proposed KernelSHAP model is more computationally efficient than older Shapley sampling, especially for high number of uninformative features.

![](/collections/images/shap/shap_fig3.jpg)

As stated earlier, LIME do not follow Shapley values which hinder its local accuracy but also leads to unintuitive results when comparing to human explanations. In the following figure, the authors compare SHAP and LIME explanations of simple model predictions to human explanations of the same model predictions. Assuming that good explanation models should be consistent with human understanding of a solution, the proposed SHAP model is better than existing methods.

![](/collections/images/shap/shap_fig4.jpg)

Below is an example (not present in the reviewed paper) of how SHAP values can be interpreted. This waterfall plot shows how each feature "force" the value of the final prediction. This plot starts as the expected value of the model output (at the bottom) and add individual effects up to the real prediction.

![](/collections/images/shap/shap_example.jpg)

(In this case, the plot explains an XGBoost model which is by default explained in terms of its margin output, so the x-axis are in log-odds units.)

# Conclusions

The authors proposed a framework unifying feature importance type of local explanation models, with a strong theoretical background. They also "fixed" existing methods to match their framework, showing at the same time improved computational efficiency.
