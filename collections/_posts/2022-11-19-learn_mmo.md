# Introduction
Variational approaches are used to solve inverse problem.

# Inverse problem and notations


# Highlights
In this article, they propose: 
- A theorem that prove that they can approximate the resolvant of a Maximally Monotone Operator (MMO) with a neural network
- A framework to be able to learn the resolvant of a MMO.
