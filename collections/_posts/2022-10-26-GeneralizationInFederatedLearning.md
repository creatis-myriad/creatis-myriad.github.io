# Introduction
The authors propose to reformulate the expected risk minimization problem commonly considered in machine learning optimization as a two level minimization problem in a federated setup, defining the risk on a distribution of local distributions. From there, they try to explore the notions of generalization and overfitting in a federated context.

# Highlights

* Define the **participation gap**, reveal its connection with **data heterogeneity**, and explain differences in generalization behavior between label-based partitioning and semantic partitioning.
* Propose a **three-way split** for measuring out-of-sample and participation gaps in centralized and FL settings where data is drawn from *a distribution of distributions*,
* Observe **significant participation gaps** across different tasks and perform empirical studies on how number of clients, client diversity, etc. affect generalization performance,
* Observe **significant differences in generalization behavior** across *naturally-partitioned* and *synthetically-partitioned* federated datasets,
* Propose **semantic partitioning** as a synthetic partitioning principle.

# Theoretical contributions
## Definition of a federated learning problem
To correctly present the few theoretical ideas of the paper, we rewrite the notations and hypothesis of the authors.

* *Let $$ \Xi $$ be the collection of all the possible image-label pairs,*
* *For any parameters $$w$$ in a parameter space $$\Theta$$, $$f(w,\xi)$$ the loss at element $$\xi\in\Xi$$ with parameter $$w$$,*
* *Let $$C$$ be the collection of all the possible clients. A client $$c\in C$$ is associated with a local distribution $$D_c$$ supported on $$\Xi$$,*
* *Assume there is a meta-distribution $$P$$ supported on client set $$C$$, and each client $$c$$ is associated with a weight $$\rho_c$$ for aggregation.*

**The proposed formulation of a federated learning problem in this setup is to optimize**

$$ F(w) = F_{unpart}(w) := \mathbb{E}_{c\sim P}\left[\rho_c*\mathbb{E}_{\xi\sim D_c}[f(w,\xi)]\right] $$

The formulation is more justified in a cross-device setting (with a large amount of clients, e.g. local distributions).

## Empirical risks and generalization gaps

* *Let $$\hat{C}$$ be the participating clients, drawn from the meta-distribution $$P$$,*
* *For each $$c\in\hat{C}$$, let $$\hat{\Xi}_c$$ be the participating training client data, drawn from the local distribution $$D_c$$.*

**They further define the *empirical risk* on the participating training client data with**

$$ F_{part\_train}(w) := \frac{1}{|\hat{C}|}\underset{c\in \hat{C}}{\sum}[\rho_c*(\frac{1}{|\hat{\Xi}_c|}\underset{\xi\in\hat{\Xi}_c}{\sum} f(w,\xi))]$$

**And the *semi-empirical risk* on the participating validation client data with**

$$ F_{part\_val}(w) := \frac{1}{|\hat{C}|}\underset{c\in\hat{C}}{\sum}[\rho_c*(\mathbb{E}_{\xi\sim D_c}f(w,\xi))]$$

They finally define two levels of generalization gap:

* **The out-of-sample gap: $$ F_{part\_val}(w) - F_{part\_train}(w)$$**
* **The partipation gap: $$ F_{unpart}(w) - F_{part\_val}(w)$$**

## Highlighted properties
The participation gap:

* *is an intrinsic property of FL due to heterogeneity*. The gap will not exist if data is homogeneous,
* *can quantify client diversity* (comparable between tasks),
* *can measure overfitting on the population distribution*,
* *can quantify model robustness to unseen clients*,
* *can quantify the incentive for clients to participate*.

# Practical contributions
## The three-way validation split

Each column corresponds to the dataset of one client. A
dataset is split into participating training, participating
validation, and unparticipating data, which enables
separate measurement of out-of-sample and participation gaps.

## Two levels of generalization gap in practice

* With federated learning

* But even with centralized training

## Label partitioning is not enough to simulate heterogeneity

* To explore federated learning when there are no large federated datasets accessible, one can synthetically partition a public dataset.
* Simulating the heterogeneity of a federated dataset by generating partitions with different label distributions alter the training processes compared to a naturally heterogeneous federated dataset.

## Semantic partitioning

The proposed partitioning protocol is the following for a classification task:

* For each label, extract semantic features with a pretrained neural network. Fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to cluster pretrained embeddings into $$C$$ groups: **intra-client intra-label consistency**.
* Then, the aim is to compute an optimal multipartite matching with cost-matrix defined by KL-divergence between the Gaussian clusters. They approximate an optimal solution by sequentially solving the optimal bipartite matching for randomly-chosen label pairs: **intra-client inter-label consistency**.

# Conclusions

* The authors proposed variants of the classical empirical risk adapted to heterogeneous federated learning,
* They proposed a three-way validation split to measure the two highlighted generalization gaps,
* They proposed a semantic partitioning to synthetize realistic heterogeneous partitionings of classification datasets.
