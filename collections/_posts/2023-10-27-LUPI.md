# Highlights

* This paper introduces to a new leanrning paradigm called LUPI.
* The addition of privileged information during the training even if it is not during the inference improves the performances.
* The paradigm is tested on three different applications.

# Introduction



# Problematization



# Privileged information in SVM type algorithms: the SVM+ method



# Three examples of privileged information

## Advanced technival model as privileged information: protein folding


## Future events as privileged information: Mackey-Glass series


## Hollistic description as privileged information: digits classification



# Discussion
