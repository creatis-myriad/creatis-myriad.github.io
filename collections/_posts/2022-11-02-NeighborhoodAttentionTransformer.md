# Notes

* Code is available on [github](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer)
* This work was done by the same team that did the Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) reviewed in this [post](https://creatis-myriad.github.io./2022/06/13/CompactConvolutionalTransformer.html)
* So they use the same method of Convolutional Tokenization

# Highlights

* Similar to Swin Transformer the idea is to reduce the computational cost of the attention mechanism 
* The authors introduce the Neighborhood Attention (NA) and the Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT)
* **With the Neighborhood Attention the attention is only computed on a neighborhood around each token**
* This method not only allows to reduce the computational cost of the attention mechanism but also helps to introduce local inductive biases
* The drawback is that it reduces the receptive field

# Neighborhood Attention

![](/collections/images/NeighborhoodAttentionTransformer/NeighborhoodAttention.jpg)

Neighborhood attention on a single pixel $$(i, j)$$ is defined as follows:

$$ NA(X_{i, j}) = softmax(\frac{Q_{i,j}K^T_{\rho(i,j)} + B_{i,j}}{scale})V_{\rho_{(i,j)}} $$

where:

-  $$Q, K, V$$ are linear projections of $$X$$

- $$B_{i,j}$$ denotes the relative positional bias

- ρ(i, j) is a fixed-length set of indices of pixels nearest to (i, j). For a neighborhood of size $$ L * L $$, $$ \vert \rho(i,j) \vert = L^2$$

> However, if the function ρ maps each pixel to all pixels ($$L²$$ is equal to feature map size), this will be equivalent to self attention.

- The complexity of the neighborhood attention is linear with respect to resolution unlike self attention's.
- The function $$\rho$$ which maps a pixel to a set of neighboring pixels is realized with a sliding window.
- For corner pixels that cannot be centered, the neighborhood is expanded to maintain receptive field size. As illustrated in the image below.

- For the tokenization they use the overlapping convolution method introduced in the  [Compact Convolutional Transformer](https://creatis-myriad.github.io./2022/06/13/CompactConvolutionalTransformer.html)

- The rest of the architecture is a succession of blocks containing a token merging layer to reduce dimension and a standard multi head attention block but with the self attention replaced by the neighborhood attention

- The token merging layer is also different from the patch merging layer in the Swin Transformer

- Here the overlapping downsampler consists of a 3x3 convolution with 2x2 strides on the patches

# Results

## Classification

- Trained on ImageNet-1k (1.2 millions images for training, 1000 classes)

- NAT outperforms Swin Transformers and ConvNeXt

## Object Detection

- Mask R-CNN and Cascade Mask R-CNN with different backbones trained on MS-COCO

## Semantic Segmentation

- UPerNet with different backbones trained on ADE20K (20 000 training images)

![](/collections/images/NeighborhoodAttentionTransformer/results_semantic_segmentation.jpg)

- NAT performs better than Swin Transformer for the segmentation task
- But NAT fails to beat ConvNeXt, a recent and very efficient convolutional network 

## Ablation studies

- To attest the efficiency of the Neighborhood Attention, they test their architecture on ImageNet-1k with different kinds of attention

- They also study different merging methods with a Swin Transformer to attests the efficiency of the Overlapping Downsampler

# Conclusion

This paper introduces a new and interesting attention mechanism based on the neighborhood of a token. It builds a transformer architecture based on this mechanism that achieves competitive results on different computer visions tasks.
