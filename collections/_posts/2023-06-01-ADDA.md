# What is Domain Adaptation ?

A *domain* can be seen as the underlying distribution that was sampled to obtain a given dataset.
For instance let us consider that $$ \mathcal{X} $$ is the space in which the samples live and $$ \mathcal{Y} $$ the space of their annotations/labels.
A *domain* is the joint distribution $$ p(x,y) $$ on $$ \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} $$ that you have to sample to produce a dataset.
By sampling $$ p(x,y) $$ one obtain a (sample, label) pair, i.e., $$ x,y \sim p(x,y) $$.
And sampling $$ n $$ times from the *domain* yields a dataset composed of $$ n $$ (sample, label) pairs $$ \{ x_{i}, y_{i} \}_{i=1}^{n} $$.

*Domain Adaptation (DA)*  is part of the *transfer learning*[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2] research field. The later aims at transferring capabilities of a trained (deep) model on new tasks (e.g., classification $$ \rightarrow $$ segmentation) and/or on new domains (e.g., classification $$ \rightarrow $$ segmentation). *Domain Adaptation (DA)* is restricted to doing the transfer on a new __target domain__, but still performing the **same task** as trained on the __source domain__. A motivation for DA is that one can reuse a model trained on a source domain and apply it on a target domain, even if the target domain is not annotated.

# Generalized adversarial framework

Let's introduce their first contribution by citing directly the paper :
> In unsupervised adaptation, we assume access to source images $$X_s$$ and labels $$Y_s$$ drawn from a source domain distribution $$p_s(x, y)$$, as well as target images $$X_t$$ drawn from a target distribution $$p_t(x, y)$$, where there are no label observations. Our goal is to learn a target representation, $$M_t$$ and classifier $$C_t$$ that can correctly classify target images into one of $$K$$ categories at test time, despite the lack of in domain annotations.

To compare the adversarial methods that try to achieve such an adaptation (i.e., training an encoder $$M_t$$ and a classifier $$C_t$$ so that $$C_t(M_t(x_t))$$ is a correct prediction as much as possible), the authors propose a generalized adversarial framework which requires to choose three elements :
  - the base model (disciminative or generative)
  - the weight sharing strategy (shared or unshared)
  - the adversarial loss (confusion, minimax, GAN, ...)

Here is an illustration of this generalized adversarial framework:

# Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA)

Here are the characteristics of the method they propose :
  - base model : discriminative
  - weight sharing strategy : unshared
  - adversarial loss : GAN

For the choice of a discriminative model, they argue that :
> modeling the image distributions (input domain = full scale images) is not strictly necessary to achieve domain adaptation, as long as the latent feature space is domain invariant.

For the choice of an independent source and target mappings (untying the weights), they argue that :
> This is a more flexible learing paradigm as it allows more domain specific feature extraction to be learned. However, note that the target domain has no label access, and thus without weight sharing a target model may quickly learn a degenerate solution if we do not take care with proper initialization and training procedures. Therefore, we use the pre-trained source model as an intitialization for the target representation space and fix the source model during adversarial training.

For the choice of the adversarial loss, they argue that :
> we are effectively learning an asymmetric mapping, in which we modify the target model so as to match the source distribution. This is most similar to the original generative adversarial learning setting, where a generated space is updated until it is indistinguishable with a fixed real space. Therefore, we choose the inverted label GAN loss described in the previous section.

Here is an illustration of the proposed ADDA method :

<p style="text-align: center;font-style:italic;">Figure 2: Pipeline of the proposed ADDA method: first they pre-train a source encoder CNN using labeled source image examples. Next, they perform adversarial adaptation by learning a target encoder CNN such that a discriminator that sees encoded source and target examples cannot reliably predict their domain label. During testing, target images are mapped with the target encoder to the shared feature space and classified by the source classifier. Dashed lines indicate fixed network parameters </p>

# Experiments

The first task that on which the adaptation is evaluated consists of classifying digits (10 classes). There are three datasets (MNIST, USPS, SVHN) and the adaptation is done in the following :
  - MNIST $$ \rightarrow $$ USPS
  - USPS $$ \rightarrow $$ MNIST
  - SVHN $$ \rightarrow $$ MNIST

The second task is still classification (on objects this time) but with a cross-modality (between RGB and depth modalities) adaptation additional difficulty (NYU depth dataset):

## Conclusion

The authors proposed a unified framework for adversarial unsupervised domain adaptation techniques.  
They proposed an adaptation method (ADDA) that uses a discriminative model (discrimination task performed in the latent space), an independent-weight strategy for source and domain encoders and a GAN inspired adversarial loss.  
They evaluated their unsupervised adaptation method across four domain shifts for classification task :  
  - MNIST $$ \rightarrow $$ USPS
  - USPS $$ \rightarrow $$ MNIST
  - SVHN $$ \rightarrow $$ MNIST
  - RGB $$ \rightarrow $$ depth map (NYU depth dataset)
